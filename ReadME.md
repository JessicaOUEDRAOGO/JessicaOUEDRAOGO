### Parkinson Awareness (VR)
Immersive virtual reality experience designed to raise awareness about Parkinson’s disease by simulating motor impairments such as hand tremors and loss of precision.

Through everyday tasks like drawing, picking up objects, and precise manipulation, users experience the motor difficulties faced by people living with Parkinson’s disease.  
The project aims to promote empathy and understanding through an accessible and intuitive VR interaction.
